Easily create notes/instructions for your clients - with widgets!

== Description ==
Dashboard Notes lets you create super simple notes and instructions for your clients within the WordPress dashboard. Choose the color of the notification, whether or not to include a logo, and exactly what pages to include the notification on (uses simple URL matching).

= Usage =
1. Install the Dashboard Notes.
2. Go to Appearance > Widgets where you will see a new "Dashboard Notes" sidebar.
3. To create a note, simply drag a new widget into the sidebar and give it some content (we typically use a text/HTML widget).
4. Once you've added content to the widget, click save, and the Dashboard Notes settings for this widget will appear.
5. Adjust the settings to meet your needs, and click save when you're done.
6. Refresh, or navigate to any page to see your new note in action.

= Credits =
